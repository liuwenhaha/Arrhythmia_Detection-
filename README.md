# Arrhythmia_Detection-
The project involves predicting the type of arrhythmia into 16 classes using various machine learning models. Using preprocessing techniques like SMOTE and Feature selection using Extra-Tree classifier we improve the previous accuracy of around 77% to 99%.The project will be uploaded as soon as the research paper on the same is published(currently in-press)
